Which of these Api are free, which are paid? Refactor the whole code base such that only free Api keys are used alongside with the Api keys we will provide. and the app delivers similar results. Optimize such that each Api query delivers cutting edge results without wasting queries. Here's what we have as of now and what you need to work on. Integrate the strategies outlied in this document to our telegram trading bot.  Here we go go:

Draw up a mind map and project structure for this trading app giving tech stacks, detailed structure, API keys and tokens to prepare etc. It should be detailed to the minutest part and should be sufficient for complete development of the app. Include any other aspects that would make it more awesome and profitable without necessarily increasing the number of APIs required. After Crafting the structure, start development. Use this : Of course. To make the prompt more elaborate and profitable without adding systemic risk requires refining the alpha (edge), enhancing the decision-making logic, and implementing more sophisticated trade execution. The goal is to increase the probability of a successful trade on each signal, thereby increasing profitability without increasing the bet size.

Here is the significantly elaborated and enhanced prompt.

Elaborate & Enhanced Implementation Prompt

Title: Build a Multi-Signal, Risk-Weighted Institutional Alpha Capture Bot

Objective: Develop a sophisticated Telegram bot that employs a multi-factor scoring system to identify high-probability, early-stage token investments based on institutional and smart money activity. The bot must execute risk-weighted position sizing and utilize advanced order types to maximize profitability while strictly managing downside risk.

Core Philosophy: Not all "smart money" buys are equal. The bot must differentiate between a high-conviction, early investment and a late, low-impact trade. Profitability is increased by allocating more capital to the highest-quality signals.

Technical Specifications & Elaborate Details

1. Advanced Data Ingestion & Signal Aggregation Module

· A. Multi-Source Data Fusion: · Primary Source (Smart Money): Integrate the Arkham Intelligence API (preferred) or Nansen API to track labeled entities. Monitor for BUY transactions. · Secondary Source (Social Sentiment): Integrate the Twitter API v2 and Telegram API (via a client like telethon). The bot must: · Scrape mentions of the token's contract address and ticker from pre-vetted alpha channels. · Perform basic sentiment analysis (using a library like TextBlob or VADER) to gauge initial hype. · Track the rate of new members joining the project's Telegram group (/chatstats command). · Tertiary Source (On-Chain Metrics): Use the DexScreener API and Birdeye API to fetch real-time, verifiable data: · Liquidity (must be locked & >$250K) · Market Cap · Holder distribution (number of holders, top 10 holder %) · Transaction volume (5m, 1h, 24h) · Creation time (reject tokens older than 48 hours) ·B. The Multi-Factor Scoring System (The "Alpha Matrix"): The bot must assign a score (0-100) to each potential token based on the following weighted factors. This score determines the trade size. · Factor 1: Smart Money Quality (Weight: 40%) · +25 points: Buyer is a top-tier VC (e.g., a16z, Paradigm, Polychain). · +15 points: Buyer is a renowned angel investor or trading firm (e.g., Cobie, Hsaka, Wintermute). · +10 points: Buyer is a mid-tier fund or a wallet with a proven track history (P/L > 100 ETH). · +0 points: Unknown or poorly performing wallet. · Factor 2: Trade Characteristics (Weight: 30%) · +20 points: One of the first 10 buys from a smart wallet. · +15 points: Purchase size is 5-10% of the liquidity pool (significant conviction). · +10 points: The wallet has not sold any of its position. · -20 points: The wallet has already taken profit on part of the position. · Factor 3: Token & Social State (Weight: 30%) · +15 points: Market Cap < $1M at time of signal. · +10 points: Social sentiment is positive and accelerating (high growth rate of mentions/members). · +5 points: Number of holders is between 100 and 500 and growing. · -30 points: Evidence of a honeypot or scam (e.g., mint function enabled, abnormal holder distribution).

1. Risk-Weighted Execution Module

· A. Position Sizing Logic: The bot's trade size is not fixed. It is a function of the signal score and a fixed percentage of the total bot capital. · Signal Score < 50: Ignore signal. Do not trade. · Signal Score 50-70: Allocate 0.5% of total bot capital. · Signal Score 70-85: Allocate 1.0% of total bot capital. · Signal Score 85+: Allocate 1.5% of total bot capital. · Example: If the bot's wallet holds $1,000, a score of 80 would trigger a $10 trade. ·B. Sophisticated Order Execution: · Use the 1inch Fusion API or CowSwap Protocol. These are MEV-protected and allow for limit orders on DEXs, which are crucial for managing slippage. · The bot should not execute a simple market buy. Instead, it should: 1. Get the current market price from DexScreener. 2. Set a limit buy order at a 2-3% premium to the current price. This ensures the trade fills quickly without incurring massive slippage from a market buy. 3. If the order does not fill within 12 blocks, it should be cancelled.

1. Dynamic Exit Strategy Module

· A. Profit-Taking Framework: The bot should use a scaling exit strategy based on the signal score. Higher conviction signals get wider profit targets. · For Scores 50-70: Sell 50% at 3x, 50% at 5x. · For Scores 70-85: Sell 33% at 5x, 33% at 8x, 34% at 10x. · For Scores 85+: Sell 25% at 5x, 25% at 10x, 25% at 15x, 25% at 20x. ·B. Stop-Loss & Trailing Logic: · Initial Stop-Loss: A hard stop-loss is set at -25% for all positions. · Trailing Stop-Loss: Once a position reaches +100% (2x), the bot should convert the stop-loss to a trailing stop-loss of 30%. This locks in profits while allowing for further upside. ·C. Degradation Exit: If the Signal Score for a held token falls below 40 (e.g., the smart money sells, social sentiment turns extremely negative), the bot should immediately exit the entire position at market price, regardless of PnL.

1. Reporting & Analytics Dashboard

· The bot must maintain a simple SQLite database to log every action: signal, score, buy price, sell price, PnL. ·A daily summary message should be sent: 📊 Daily Performance Report Signals Received: 12 Trades Executed: 2 Capital Deployed: $25.00 PnL: +$78.50 (+314%) Win Rate: 100% Best Performer: $EXAMPLE (+750%) ·A Telegram command /portfolio should return the current status of all open positions and their scores.

Final Command to Developer/AI: "Act as a senior quant developer.Based on the elaborated specification above, generate a complete system design document. Include:

1. A detailed architecture diagram showing data flow between APIs, the scoring engine, the wallet, and Telegram.
2. Pseudocode for the 'Alpha Matrix' scoring function.
3. Pseudocode for the risk-weighted position sizing logic.
4. A security protocol outline for handling private keys and signing transactions securely using a web3.py wallet instance.
5. A plan for backtesting this strategy against historical blockchain data (e.g., using the Dune Analytics API)."

This prompt shifts the focus from mere execution to intelligent, quantified decision-making, which is the only way to genuinely enhance profitability without simply increasing capital at risk. Of course. This is where we move from a very good retail bot to a system that begins to approach a professional trading desk's capabilities. The previous prompt focuses on reaction to on-chain events. The enhancements below focus on prediction, adaptation, and operational excellence.

Here is the addendum prompt designed to be attached to the previous one.

Addendum Prompt: "Project Apex" Enhancements

Objective: Augment the existing Institutional Alpha Capture Bot specification with the following advanced modules and capabilities. These enhancements are designed to increase predictive accuracy, maximize profitability through superior execution, and ensure long-term operational resilience. The goal is to create a self-optimizing system that learns from its own performance.

1. Predictive & Pre-emptive Signal Module:

· A. Seed Investment Sniping: · Integrate with CryptoRank.io or CoinMarketCap Capstone API to monitor and parse announcements of early-stage funding rounds (Seed, Private A) for projects before their Token Generation Event (TGE). · Action: The bot must automatically add the receiving project's name, expected ticker, and investor list to a watchlist. Upon the first on-chain appearance of the token contract (via DexScreener monitoring for the project name/ticker), it should immediately initiate the Alpha Matrix scoring, potentially generating a signal within the first 30 seconds of liquidity being added. ·B. Whale Wallet Proximity Alerting: · Develop heuristics to identify "proximity to execution." Beyond tracking buys, the bot should monitor smart money wallets for: · Large stablecoin inflows (e.g., receiving 500 USDC from a known exchange) which often precede a buy. · Approval transactions for a new token contract, which often occur minutes before the actual swap. · Action: Generate a "PRE-ALERT" with a lower confidence score, allowing for even earlier positioning.

1. Advanced Execution & Slippage Mitigation Module:

· A. Multi-DEX Liquidity Mapping: · The bot must not just use 1inch/CowSwap. It must first query the DexLabs API or perform its own direct RPC calls to map the exact distribution of liquidity across all DEXs (Uniswap V2/V3, Sushiswap, etc.) for the target token. · Action: The execution engine should then intelligently split the user's buy order across multiple DEXs to minimize overall price impact, rather than relying on a single aggregator's algorithm. ·B. Just-In-Time (JIT) Liquidity Exploitation: · On Ethereum L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism) or Solana, sophisticated players provide instant, large liquidity that they withdraw immediately after a large trade (JIT Liquidity). The bot should be configured to seek out pools where JIT liquidity is present, as it allows for a larger trade size with minimal slippage.

1. Machine Learning & Adaptive Learning Module:

· A. Performance Feedback Loop: · The SQLite database must be designed to store not just trades, but every feature that contributed to the Alpha Matrix score for that signal. · Action: Implement a weekly review process (e.g., a scikit-learn linear regression or a simple Bayesian updater) that analyzes which factors (e.g., "Wintermute buy", "MCap < $1M") are most correlated with successful trades (e.g., ROI > 3x). The weights in the Alpha Matrix should then be automatically adjusted to reflect these learnings. The system becomes smarter over time. ·B. Win Rate / Profitability Adaptive Bet Sizing: · The position sizing logic should be dynamic at a macro level. Implement a simplified Kelly Criterion model. · If the bot's 30-day win rate is high and average return is significant, it can very cautiously increase the base capital allocation percentage (e.g., from 1.5% to 1.7% for a score of 85+). · After a string of losses, it should automatically reduce bet sizes to preserve capital.

1. Operational Security & Anti-Scam Infrastructure:

· A. Real-time Honey-Pot & Scam Detection: · Integrate a dedicated API like GoPlus Security or TokenSniffer before execution. The bot must perform a pre-trade check for: · Hidden mint functions · Modified sell fees · Ownership renunciation status · Action: A failed security check should immediately veto the trade, regardless of a high Alpha Matrix score. ·B. Multi-Signature Execution Wallet: · For users with larger capital allocations (> $5,000), the design should support using a Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet. The bot would generate and propose the transaction, but it would require a second device (e.g., the user's phone with Safe app) to confirm and sign. This eliminates the single point of failure of a hot wallet's private key.

1. Cross-Chain Intelligence Engine:

· The bot must be chain-agnostic. The data ingestion and execution modules should have plug-ins for major ecosystems: Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. ·Action: The Alpha Matrix should compare signals across chains. A token trending on Ethereum but with a much cheaper, earlier copy on Arbitrum might present a higher-risk, higher-reward opportunity.

Final Integration Command: "Integrate the specifications from'Project Apex' as mandatory modules into the previous architecture. Revise the system design diagram to include these new components. Specifically, detail the data flow for the 'Predictive Signal Module' and provide a pseudocode outline for the 'Adaptive Learning Module' that adjusts the Alpha Matrix weights based on a weekly analysis of the trades database table. Prioritize the implementation of the 'Real-time Honey-Pot Detection' check within the execution pipeline as a critical security gate."

Of course. Here is a comprehensive mind map and project structure for the "Apex Alpha Bot," incorporating all specified features and enhancements. This structure is designed for complete development.
